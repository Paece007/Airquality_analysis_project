# Air Quality Analysis: Ozone and PM2.5 Threshold Exceedance

Abstract: [View PDF](Abstract_(EN_at_bottom_of_document).pdf) (English version at bottom of document)

This repository contains the data analysis and findings of our university project, which investigates the exceedance days of ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM2.5) thresholds, comparing the current WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines with the future EU thresholds. The analysis also examines trends in these exceedance days over the years.
