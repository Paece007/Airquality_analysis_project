# Air Quality Analysis: Ozone and PM2.5 Threshold Exceedance

This repository contains the data analysis and findings of our university project, which investigates the exceedance days of ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM2.5) thresholds, comparing the current WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines with the future EU thresholds. The analysis also examines trends in these exceedance days over the years.

## Introduction

Air pollution, specifically the presence of ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5), poses significant health risks. This study focuses on evaluating the impact of different regulatory thresholds on the number of days these pollutants exceed safe levels. We compare the current WHO guidelines with the more stringent EU thresholds set to be enforced in the future. Additionally, we analyze the trends in exceedance days over recent years to understand how air quality has evolved.

## Research Question

The primary research questions addressed in this project are:
1. Does the choice of threshold (WHO vs. EU) significantly affect the number of exceedance days for ozone and PM2.5?
2. What are the trends in the number of exceedance days over the past years?

## Methodology

Our methodology includes:
- **Data Collection**: Gathering air quality data for ozone and PM2.5 from various monitoring stations.
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning and preprocessing the data for analysis.
- **Threshold Comparison**: Counting exceedance days based on WHO and future EU thresholds.
- **Trend Analysis**: Evaluating the trends over the years to identify any significant changes or patterns.

## Results

The key findings of our analysis are:
- A detailed comparison of exceedance days under WHO and EU thresholds.
- Trends indicating whether air quality is improving or deteriorating over the years.
- Statistical analysis highlighting significant differences between the two sets of guidelines.

## Discussion

Our discussion delves into:
- The implications of different regulatory thresholds on public health.
- The effectiveness of current policies in reducing air pollution.
- Recommendations for future research and policy adjustments based on our findings.

## Conclusion

This study underscores the importance of stringent air quality standards and continuous monitoring to protect public health. The comparison between WHO and EU thresholds reveals critical insights into how regulatory measures can influence the reporting and management of air quality.
